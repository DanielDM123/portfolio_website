<!-- INTRO -->
<h2 class="white title"><b>This project involved implementing three core computer graphic and animation techniques (rotoscoping, image wrapping, and keying) to create a video that was at least 30 seconds long.</b></h2>


<!-- ROTOSCOPING EXPLANATION -->
<img src="/images/RotoExample.png" alt="Example of Rotoscoping" class="float-right">

<h1 class="white title">Rotoscoping</h1>

<p class="white">Created animation by tracing live-action footage of myself frame-by-frame.</p>

<p class="white">Creating a program that stored points on the screen into an XML file.</p>

<p class="white">Once the program read the incoming frame, it draw out and connect the points read from the XML file.</p>

<p class="white">If the program notice there was only one point on the current frame, it would instead draw a PNG of a bird where the point was at.</p>


<!-- IMAGE WARPING EXPLANATION -->
 <p class="clear-float "></p>

<img src="/images/bird.gif" alt="Image Warping Example GIF" class="float-left">

<h1 class="white title">Image Warping</h1>

<p class="white ">Manipulated the PNG of the bird by translating the pixels of the head left and right.</p>

<p class="white">Achieved this by determining what y-level separated the neck and body of the bird.  </p>

<p class="white">Then, when drawing the bird image, every pixel above the threshold would move either left or right in a linear fashion by utilizing linear interpolation.  </p>

<!-- CHROMAKEYING EXPLANATION -->
<p class="clear-float "></p>

<img src="/images/greenscreenExample.png" alt="Green Screen Exmaple" class="float-right">

<h1 class="white title">Chromakeying</h1>


<p class="white">Implemented my own green screen background replacement functionality.</p>

<p class="white">The program would generates an alpha matte for each frame by applying Vlahos equations, a method used to differentiate the green screen background from the foreground.</p>

<p class="white">Afterwards, the program would compare it against a predefined garbage mask to precisely isolate the intended foreground  from extraneous background elements.</p>

<p class="clear-float "></p>


<p class="white title">If for some reason you want to watch the video, here you go. Be warned, it is a little cringey. </p>
